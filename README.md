Hello there! 👋 I’m Julia Zanevych, a passionate Full Stack Developer 🌐 with a robust background in Java ☕️ and Angular 🔺, boasting three years of immersive experience. With a Bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence 🤖, I have ventured beyond front-end and back-end paradigms to explore the intricate world of AI.

Currently, I am channeling my efforts into Machine Learning 🧠, where I aspire to innovate and elevate the tech landscape with data-driven solutions. My journey in AI has been marked by a relentless pursuit of excellence 🚀, and I thrive on tackling complex challenges that machine learning engineering presents.

When I am not decoding algorithms or crafting seamless interfaces, I indulge in the realm of detective novels 🕵️‍♀️, immersing myself in the twists and turns of mystery and suspense. Additionally, I find solace in hiking 🥾🏞️, where the serenity of nature provides a refreshing contrast to the structured logic of code.

As I continue to grow in this dynamic field, I remain eager to collaborate, contribute, and create meaningful technology that resonates with both utility and ingenuity. Let's connect and build the future together! ✨
